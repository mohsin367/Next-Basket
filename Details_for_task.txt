API Explanation:

I try to hit API from selenium but probably due to restriction it did not give any response. However I have automated complete requirement which was mentioned in the task. I created manually screenshot attached in this
project then I automated using request library with Python. I have also assert API responses.

All the tasks details available in this project.

For UI Automation I use Page Object Model technique for more readability and maintainability.
